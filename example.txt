"""
The SDK is composed of two packages: common and core.
a10sdk
|->common
|        |_A10BaseClass.py <--- This base class is inherited by a class instance. It is also 
         contains the factory that transforms json into objects
|        |_device_proxy.py <--- RestClient for making RestCalls. This client should be passed to the base object.
|
|->core
|        |_slb <-- slb Module Directory, Contains actual Python Directory.
         |    |_slb_virtual_server.py <---actual module that would be imported.
|        |_* other Modules


USAGE: To utilize the sdk you must import the modules for the objects you would like to manage.


Import the device_proxy:
"""
from a10sdk.common.device_proxy import DeviceProxy

"""
In order to get a session id for continued use we need to create a device_proxy object. The example below will get the session id. In the example we will print the session ID.
The DeviceProxy class require the hostname or ip, username, password.
"""
host = "172.17.0.232"
username = "admin"
password = "a10"
dp = DeviceProxy(host, username, password)
"""
interface management
"""
from a10sdk.core.interface.interface_management import Management

mgmt = Management(DeviceProxy=dp).get()
print mgmt.DEBUG_Response
print mgmt.__json__(mgmt)
print mgmt.access_list.acl_id
